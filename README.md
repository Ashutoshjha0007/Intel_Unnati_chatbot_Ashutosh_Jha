PROBLEM STATEMENT : Running GenAI on Intel AI Laptops and Simple LLM Inference on CPU and  fine-tuning of LLM Models using Intel® OpenVINO™

In this problem statement we must perform simple LLM inference on a CPU and understand the process of fine-tuning LLMs for custom applications. We also must become familiar with the basics of Generative AI and its applications. In the end we must produce a Custom Chatbot with Fine-tuned Pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) using Intel AI Tools.
